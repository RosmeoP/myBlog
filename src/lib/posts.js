    title: 'Outdoor boys goodbye',
    content: 'Really sad that Outdoor boys is ending. I have been watching them for a long time and they have inspired me to go outside and explore the world around me. I will miss their videos and the adventures they took us on. I hope they come back in some form in the future. I gotta respect their decision prefering to focus on their family rather than being famous, a complicated decision that not everyone can make. I wish them the best of luck in their future endeavors.',

    title: 'Discipline over Motivation',
    content: 'Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment. It’s the ability to push through when motivation wanes. While motivation can get you started, discipline keeps you going. Because when the initial excitement fades, it’s discipline that will carry you through the tough times. It’s about creating habits and routines that support your goals, even when you don’t feel like it. Remember, motivation is fleeting, but discipline is a skill that can be developed and strengthened over time, like Goggins would say, stay hard!',
